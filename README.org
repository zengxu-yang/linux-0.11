Build Linux kernel 0.11 on modern GCC 12. Run and debug it on modern QEMU with GDB. This is an ideal lab environment for OS study as Linux 0.11 is relatively small.

Features
- Patched Linux kernel 0.11 that can be built on modern GCC 12 and runs on QEMU.
- Can be source debugged by GDB.
- GCC optimization is disabled for better debugging experience.
- QEMU Monitor is enabled when debugging Linux kernel 0.11 for more CPU internal info.

It has been tested on Debian 12. To run or debug it, you need to download the root image from [[https://github.com/JiangJiangjungle/oslab/blob/master/hdc-0.11.img][here]] and put it in the project root directory.

To install it, you need to install necessary tools.
#+begin_src text
  sudo apt install gcc gdb make bin86 qemu-system-x86
#+end_src
Clone the source code, then
#+begin_src text
  make clean
  make
#+end_src
to build it. QEMU needs to be patched to debug 16-bit real mode code.
